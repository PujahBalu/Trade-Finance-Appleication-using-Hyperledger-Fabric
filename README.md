Abstract:

This paper explores the shift in trade finance using blockchain technology and Hyperledger fabric. Trade finance refers to financial transactions that may be both domestic and international, which relate to trade receivables finance and global trade. One of the difficulties involved in trade finance is that the large volume of paper documents that still structure much of the data flow. Banks are seeking to cut back costs and increase efficiency by replacing the flow of paper for trade finance with digital data flows. Blockchain technology ensures that data is tamper-proof (highly secured), traceable, and trustworthy. The certificate authority, channel, Private Data Collection, etc are the basic framework and privacy protection mechanisms of Hyperledger Fabric. The transactions done through blockchain are tamper-proof as it does not involve a third-party involvement and this blockchain system is decentralized.
